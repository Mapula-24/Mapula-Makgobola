    The mission of **Mpuley's Embers**, is to create handcrafted candles that bring cosiness and warmth into every household.  With an emphasis on sustainability and quality, we utilise only the best materials, choosing natural waxes and essential oils with care to create unique smells that take you to peaceful settings and comfortable havens.  Every candle, from calming lavender fields to energising citrus orchards, is carefully hand-poured to guarantee a steady burn and a captivating atmosphere.  Our candles are a thoughtful way to add light and peace to any place, whether you're looking to improve your own or give them as a special present. Mpuley's Embers  wants to light up your world, one candle at a time, with an emphasis on environmentally sustainable operations and client happiness.
